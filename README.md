## What is Reliev ?
Reliev is a platform to put through companies and professionnal masseurs. It will allow employees to profit massages on their working space, with reservations made by companies through the Reliev application. Masseurs will just have to sign up and indicate their services.

## Testing the app
The application is not finished yet, here are a few indications :
- sign in/up as a company : https://reliev-prod.herokuapp.com/companies/sign_up
- sign in/up as a employee (an employee gets his invite from the company) : https://reliev-prod.herokuapp.com/employees/sign_up
- when you sign up or reset your password, the email you will receive will be considered as a spam.
- soon, new functionnalities will be implemented, such as 
  1. informations about masseurs disponibilities, 
  2. researching a masseur depending on criteria, 
  3. the company will be able to book masseurs, and 
  4. companies will invite employees
